# Snake

A simple snake game for our [Ubrowse](https://sites.google.com/site/ubrowseapp/) _search failed_ page !

### Fatures to be added:
  * A **swipe to direct** feature to change the snake's direction using [jQuery mobile](https://jquerymobile.com).
  * A **score board** to level up and save High score in `localStorage`.
  * New **snake designs** to change the snake as one levels up (serpent < python < taipan < Cobra)
  * Adding **obstacles** blocking the snake's way, one touch, and GAME OVER!!
  * Adding a **bonus level** where the snak has to go through a maze to find treasure (the obstacles won't give damage)
  * Adding a **fancy loader**, rather than the progress bar with `CurlzMT` font-family as the assets load in the background.

Let's use this for now while working on DinoRun 3d too...
